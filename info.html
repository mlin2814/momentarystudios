            <p>
                Hello, my name is Matthew and I'm glad you're taking the time to read this.
                I'm an amateur photographer that enjoys taking photos that commemorate special occasions.
                I do this all in my free time and with my resources, and am not influenced by making this into
                a professional venture. My view is to record my experiences as best as I can, and to share
                my work with others so that they may enjoy it as well. Generally, my photos are of places I go to 
                or cosplayers I meet at conventions. I always share photos with the cosplayers as they 
                so rarely actually get to see their work directly from the photographer. 
                I want to recognize their hard work and let them enjoy my perspective of their efforts.
                Any time I can capture the moment with my camera, I'll do my best to get the most out of it.
            </p>
